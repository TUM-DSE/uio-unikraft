 * The idea is that the @p ops contains the above two functions, which come
 * from a transport. However, since the transport can be not only pci
 * (but also, MMIO, for example), these operations have to be implemented by
 * a transport. And supplied to vfdev device through @p ops.
 * The question is, how to supply them. This has to be built.
 * One thing to consider is that the transporzt that supplies the @p ops, has
 * to match the transport, that is used by the @p fuse_dev.
